I think the reason make me so crazy is I feel very lonely and I lost my interest about programming. I feel very lonely at home because two of my cousin is in Canada now and I think the cousin that live with me is very mean. And I don't know why I lost my interest of programming, now I still want to do programming but when I start I feel it is so hard and boring. Yeah, sometimes I lost my hobby is just because I have other hobby, like I moved my interest from chemistry to computer. But this time, I find that I don't like anything else. And this make my life very boring. I think that is because my computer be take away for half year by my parents.
